# Learning_web-development
In this repository, I will be committing all the code files of my html/css/js code as I learn web development

This website is being hosted on github pages too
url : https://rahul-joon.github.io/Learning_web-development/

you can even jump in between different files by modifieing the url for example putting - *1. HTML* will take you to the Html learning page.


### As of today *(2-02-2022)*, I have complete the *Html* vids and the first *CSS* vid.
The Syntax is just way vast, so it would be way better to not waste time in writing down notes, rather keep some cheat-sheet links ready or just search suntax on the interent. Some Cheat-sheet links have been attached below.
